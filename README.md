- As shown in the table these are the brands that have the cheapest selling items, one of the highest available discount while maintaining the trusts of their customers which is shown in their rating. Ratings after all is a great thing to show for the first impression as this indicates that you are a trustable brand, and the quality of your items is favorable if not great.

  The brands Pu and REEB seems to be the leading brands here they are almost the same in terms of Lowest available, Lowest Available Selling Price(discount applied), Average Ratings   on each category and Highest Available Discount. This means that going with these two brands most likely will not fail to meet you expectations but if you don't like their items     you can also go for ARBO and Free Authori, just a smidge expensive but not much they also have a great ratings.
